ðŸš€ **Project Alert:** Multiplication App is LIVE! ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my newly completed project â€” **Multiplication App** â€” built using **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**.
You can try it out here: **[https://vaibhavsain.github.io/Multiplication-App/](https://vaibhavsain.github.io/Multiplication-App/)**

This is what I aimed for and learned along the way:

* ðŸ”¢ **Interactive Practice** â€” Users get random multiplication problems, input answers, and see instant feedback.
* ðŸŽ¯ **Score Tracking & Flow** â€” Keeps count of correct answers, making it engaging and game-like.
* ðŸ’¡ **Fundamental Skills Strengthened** â€” I deepened my understanding of **DOM manipulation**, **event listeners**, **validation**, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.
* ðŸ“± **Responsive Styling** â€” Clean design and responsiveness achieved using CSS.

This project is a small but mighty step in my journey of building useful tools and sharpening my web dev skills. Always learning, always building! ðŸ’ª

If youâ€™re curious about the code, features, or want to share feedback â€” Iâ€™d love to connect and chat.
